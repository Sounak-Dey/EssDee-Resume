EssDee-Resume 
=========================
As one can guess, this is forked from the Deedy-Resume.

A **one-page**, **two asymmetric column** resume template in **XeTeX** that caters particularly to an **undergraduate Computer Science** student.
As of **v1.2**, there is an option to choose from two templates:

1. **MacFonts** - uses fonts native to OSX - *Helvetica*, *Helvetica Neue* (and it's Light and Ultralight versions) and the CJK fonts *Heiti SC*, and *Heiti TC*. The EULA of these fonts prevents distribution on Open Source.
2. **OpenFonts** - uses free, open-source fonts that resemble the above - *Lato* (and its various variants) and *Raleway*.

It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## Motivation

This template attempts to **look clean**, highlight **details**, be a **single page**, and allow useful **LaTeX templating**.

## Dependencies

1. Compiles only with **XeTeX** and required **BibTex** for compiling publications and the .bib filetype.
2. Uses fonts that are usually only available to **Mac** users such as Helvetica Neue Light.

## Availability
