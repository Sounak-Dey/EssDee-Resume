EssDee-Resume 
=========================
As one can guess, this is inspired from the Deedy-Resume.

A **one-page**, **two asymmetric column** resume template in **XeTeX** that caters particularly to an **undergraduate Computer Science** student.

**OpenFonts** - uses free, open-source fonts - *Lato* (and its various variants) and *Raleway*.

## Motivation

This template attempts to **look clean**, highlight **details**, be a **single page**, and allow useful **LaTeX templating**.

## Dependencies

1. Compiles only with **XeTeX** and required **BibTex** for compiling publications and the .bib filetype.
2. Uses fonts that are usually only available to **Mac** users such as Helvetica Neue Light.
