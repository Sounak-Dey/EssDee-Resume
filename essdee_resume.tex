\runsubsection{NP Lab Reports}
\descript{| Angular + Spring Boot + Jupyter Lab}
\location{Jan 2021 - May 2021}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item A collaboration between the \textbf{E-Health Research Center (EHRC)} of \textbf{IIIT-B} and  \textbf{National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS)}. 
\item The project aims at replacing the current Excel-based format to provide a more suitable format of search engine for the \textbf{diagnosis reports} of the \textbf{Pathology Lab} of \textbf{NIMHANS}, which allows the user to do \textbf{context-based searches} on the reports, that will, in turn, return more efficient results, making the work of the medical staff easier.
\item During the search, it also provides necessary \textbf{recommendations} on the basis of corpus for both site and diagnosis. The project also provides automatic parsing for newly uploaded files. 
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{The Gift Library}
\descript{| React + Spring Boot + CI/CD DevOps}
\location{Apr 2021 - May 2021}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a \textbf{web application}, 'The Gift Library' keeping in mind the need for getting  \textbf{fully personalised gifts} for our dear ones, and the fact that, a solution to this exact problem is yet to exist.
\item Through The Gift Library users will be able to get a gift by contacting the right artists whose work they like (after browsing through them all), and personalise it fully to perfectly fit their requirements .
\item Implemented the \textbf{CI/CD DevOps} toolchain using: \\
Source Control Management - \textbf{Git (GitHub)}, 
Continuous Integration - \textbf{Jenkins}, 
Containerization - \textbf{Docker (DockerHub)},
Continuous Deployment - \textbf{RunDeck}.\\
Monitoring - \textbf{ELK stack(Elastic Search, Logstash, Kibana)}.

\runsubsection{Mercari Price Suggestion}
\descript{| Kaggle Dataset + Classical ML }
\location{Oct 2020 - Nov 2020}
\begin{tightemize}
\item \textbf{Mercari} is Japanâ€™s biggest community-powered shopping app where sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things.
\item The problem was to build an algorithm that automatically \textbf{suggests} the right \textbf{prices} for these products \textbf{from the user-inputted text descriptions} of their \textbf{products}, including details like product category name, brand name, item condition, etc..
\item We  were  able  to  come up  with  an  efficient \textbf{LightGBM} model  with an  \textbf{RMSLE} score of \textbf{0.436}, to predict the price of a given product online, based on the various information and descriptions we have at our disposal about the product.
