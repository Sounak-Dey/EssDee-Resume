\runsubsection{NP Lab Reports}
\descript{| Angular + Spring Boot + Jupyter Lab}
\location{Jan 2021 - May 2021}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item A collaboration between the \textbf{E-Health Research Center (EHRC)} of \textbf{IIIT-B} and  \textbf{National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS)}. 
\item The project aims at replacing the current Excel-based format to provide a more suitable format of search engine for the \textbf{diagnosis reports} of the \textbf{Pathology Lab} of \textbf{NIMHANS}, which allows the user to do context-based searches on the reports, that will, in turn, return more efficient results, making the work of the medical staff easier.
\item During the search, it also provides necessary recommendation on the basis of corpus for both site and diagnosis. The project also provides automatic parsing for newly uploaded files. 
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{The Gift Library}
\descript{| React + Spring Boot + CI/CD DevOps}
\location{Apr 2021 - May 2021}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a Web-App, 'The Gift Library' keeping in mind the need for getting fully personalised gifts for our dear ones, and the fact that, a solution to this exact problem is yet to exist.
\item Through The Gift Library users will be able to get a gift by contacting the right artists whose work they like (after browsing through them all), and personalise it fully to perfectly fit their requirements .
\item Implemented the \textbf{CI/CD DevOps} toolchain using: \\
Source Control Management - \textbf{Git (GitHub)}, 
Continuous Integration - \textbf{Jenkins}, 
Containerization - \textbf{Docker (DockerHub)},
Continuous Deployment - \textbf{RunDeck}.\\
Monitoring - \textbf{ELK stack(Elastic Search, Logstash, Kibana)}.

\runsubsection{Mercari Price Suggestion}
\descript{| Kaggle Dataset + Classical ML }
\location{Oct 2020 - Nov 2020}

\begin{tightemize}
\item Built a regression model that automatically suggests the right prices for products. We have made a model using traditional machine learning methods to predict the sale price of a listing based on information a user provides for this listing.
\item We  were  able  to  come up  with  an  efficient \textbf{LightGBM} model  with an  \textbf{RMSLE} score of \textbf{0.436}, to predict the price of a given product online, based on the various information and descriptions we have at our disposal about the product.
